## Developer instructions

### Setup
One repository has been downloadned/cloned, perform a `git pull` to make sure everything is up to date.

In the terminal run `npm install`.  This will download all of the project's dependencies into the node_modules folder.

### To run the server

In the terminal run `node server.js` to start up the server on port 3000. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in order to view the live locally-hosted website.

Alternatively, you can run `nodemon server.js` which will behave the same as above except it will live-reload when the server.js file is saved.  HTML & CSS changes should be automatically reflected here too.

**Note that links to static files like image assets and css files should work without issue.  Many of the URLs linking to internal pages however still need be updated to `/` for the home page, `/about` for the About page, `/rooms` for the Rooms page and so on.
